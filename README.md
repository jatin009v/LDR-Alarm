What is LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)?
A photoresistor is an active component that decreases resistance with 
respect to receiving luminosity on the component's sensitive surface. 
The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increase in incident light
intensity; in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity.
You can follow the image given below in order to connect all the necessary components and then all you need to do 
is to simply compile and upload the given code to your board.
